# garbage, for now

## Aim

For those working in modern *Internet* companies, or *AI* companies if you are reading this several years from now. I aim to:

- **Teach:** Try to develop a fast-learning process to help others grasp programming as quickly as possible. Focuses on speed so it does not guarantee insightful knowledge. However, some interesting stuff would be provided marked optional.
- **Teach Me:** Should be able to review or preview many important topics in our industry.
- **Improve:** Since we are working in a fast-changing industry, the ability of fast-learning, or revolutionizing ourselves, is in itself the most valuable asset. Hopefully, a system of fast-learning could be established within this project.

## Method

Pick any topic you want. But I would recommend (with bias :P):
- For data scientist or anyone who wishes to learn AI (Trending): `Python` -> `Big Data` -> `Machine Learning`
- For those who want to build a website: `LNMP`
- For those who want to have some fun and see immediate feedback: `Fronend`
- For students or those who wish to find jobs: `Java` -> `Algorithms`
- For architects: `PowerPoint`
- For architects who want to write some code besides powerpoints: `C++` -> `Search Engine`/`Distributed Systems`

## Basic

### Java

Grasp Java Programming in a few days with [a simple online tutorial](https://beginnersbook.com/java-tutorial-for-beginners-with-examples/).

1.  Java Fundamentals: [https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/jvm/](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/jvm/)
    Java Development Kit > Java Runtime Environment > Java Virtual Machine

    .java -> `$javac` -> .class -> `$java`
